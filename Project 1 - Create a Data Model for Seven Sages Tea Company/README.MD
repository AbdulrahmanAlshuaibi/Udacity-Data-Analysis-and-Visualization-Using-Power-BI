## **Project Overview**
The mission of this project is to tame the datasets and create an efficient data model for a small brewing company that will help them better understand what products are popular and profitable so they can mark smart decisions about what products to prioritize as the company continues to grow. 

## **Main Steps**
**Core data modeling principles are demonstrated, including:** 
1. Using the Power Query Editor to transform data from source files into desired table structures for a data model.
2. Cleaning data and correct formatting as needed to meet the needs of a given data model.
3. Creating a date table in PowerQuery that meets reporting requirements, including fiscal years.
4. Building measures that meet key reporting requirements.
    - Sales in USD ($)
    - Cost of Sales USD ($)
    - Gross Profit Margin (or GPM) in USD (%)
    - Sales in CAD ($)
    - Unit Sales by Product (%)
    - Share of gross profit by Product type (%)
5. Creating a simple table, matrix, and card visualizations in Power BI to test and validate the accuracy of a given data model, including measures.
